we propose the adoption of deep learning to detect whether there's a COVID-19 presence in X-ray images by exploiting transfer learning. thus proposes an improved algorithm of convolutional neural network VGG-16 and VGG-19 using deep learning to realize this goal. this may represent a suggestion for the radiologist to right away localize the X-ray areas that may be of interest.
